###ActiveSTMv3 mode
This mode is similar to PassiveSTMv3 mode, the real STM module (v1/2/3) is removed from the PHC system, and P2M takes it&#39;s place. P2M will
be the master of the PHC module bus and talks directly to the PHC modules.

The difference is that ActiveSTMv3 mode will use the internal programming as defined in the SystemSoftware v3, so an event coming from a
PHC module will be handled like a real STM does. It will find out what actions are linked to the event and carry them out.
